## Key Features
- Atomic-point-cloud-based deep learning library for materials and molecules.
- A unified point cloud representation of molecules and materials.
- Grad-CAM based interpretability module.
- Implementation in PyTorch

## Setting Up:
- Python: 3.10.18
- We provided environment.yml for setting up PONY. However, for constructing the benchmark sets, other packages are required. For this, consult the provided Jupyter Notebooks.
